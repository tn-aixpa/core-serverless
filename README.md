Nuclio "Serverless"-based framework for Job/serverless executions compatible with DH Core. The product is a set of python images that can be used to run serverless jobs in a Kubernetes cluster.

## Development

See CONTRIBUTING for contribution instructions.

### Build container images

To build the container image, you need to:

Clone the repository and navigate to the `digitalhub-serverless` directory. The build process consists of three main steps:

- Build the processor image (modify the `Makefile` file to change the SERVERLESS_DOCKER_REPO and SERVERLESS_CACHE_REPO variable to your Docker repository, e.g., `docker.io/yourusername`)

```bash
make processor
```

- Build the base image (chooses the Python 3 version from 9, 10, 11 or 12)

```bash
docker build -t python-base-3-<ver> -f ./Dockerfile/Dockerfile-base-3-<ver> .
```

- Build the onbuild image (Modify the `Dockerfile/Dockerfile-onbuild-3-<ver>` file to change the SERVERLESS_DOCKER_REP variable to your Docker repository, e.g., `docker.io/yourusername`)

```bash
docker build -t python-onbuild-3-<ver> -f ./Dockerfile/Dockerfile-onbuild-3-<ver> .
```

- Build the runtime image  (Modify the `Dockerfile/Dockerfile-handler-3-<ver>` file to change the NUCLIO_BASE_IMAGE and NUCLIO_ONBUILD_IMAGE variables that point to the base and onbuild image you just built, e.g., `python-onbuild-3-<ver>`)

```bash

docker build -t python-runtime-3-<ver> -f ./Dockerfile/Dockerfile-handler-3-<ver> --build-arg GIT_TAG=<some-tag> .
```

### Launch container

To run the container, use the following command:

```bash
docker run -e PROJECT_NAME=<project-name> -e RUN_ID=<run-id> python-runtime-3-<ver>
```

Required environment variables:

- `PROJECT`: The name of the project
- `RUN_ID`: The ID of the run to execute
